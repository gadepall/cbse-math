Kite festival is celebrated in many countries at different times of the year. in India, every year 14th
January is celebrated as international kite Day. on his day many people visit India and participate in the festival by flying various kinds of kites.
\\The picture given below \figref{fig:kites5} , three kites flying together.

\\In \figref{fig:kites5}, the angles of elevation of two kites (point C) are found to be $\degree{30}$ and  $\degree{60}$ respectively. Taking \begin{align}AD = 50 m\end{align} and\begin{align} BE = 60 m\end{align}
find 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The length of string used (take them straight) for kites A and B as shown in the figure.
\item The distance 'd' between these two kites
\end{enumerate}
