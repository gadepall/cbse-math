    \item Find whether the following pair of linear equations are consistent or inconsistent:
    \begin{align*}
     5x - 3y = 11, -10x + 6y = 22.
    \end{align*}
    \item Solve for $x$ and $y$:
    \begin{align*}
    x + y = 6, 2x - 3y = 4.
    \end{align*}
    \item Find out whether the pair of equations $2x + 3y = 0$ and $2x - 3y = 26$ is consistent or inconsistent.
    
    \item For what values of $k$, does the pair of linear equations $kx - 2y = 3$ and $3x + y = 5$ have a unique solution?
    
    \item What type of lines will you get by drawing the graph of the pair of equations $x - 2y + 3 = 0$ and $2x - 4y = 5$?
    
    \item The sum of the numerator and the denominator of a fraction is $18$. If the denominator is increased by $2$, the fraction reduces to $\frac{1}{3}$. Find the fraction.
    
    \item Find the value of $k$ for which the system of equations $x + 2y = 5$ and $3x + ky + 15 = 0$ has no solution.
    
    \item If $2$ tables and $2$ chairs cost \rupee $700$ and $4$ tables and $3$ chairs cost \rupee $1,250$, then find the cost of one table.
    
    \item If the graph of a pair of lines $x - 2y + 3 = 0$ and $2x - 4y = 5$ be drawn, then what type of lines are drawn?
