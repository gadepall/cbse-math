\item During the lockdown period,many families got bored of watching TV all the time.Out of these families, one family of 6 members decided to play a card game.17 cards numbered 1,2,3,4,..,17 are put in a box and mixed thoroughly.One card is drawn by one member at random and other family members bet for the chances of drawing the number either prime,odd or even etc.

\item  During summer break, Harish wanted to play with his friends but it was too hot outside, so he decided to play some indoor game with his friends. He collects $20$ identical Icards and writes the numbers $1$ to $20$ on them (one number on one card). He puts them in a box. He and his friends make a bet for the chances of drawing various cards out of the box. Ench was given a chance to tell the probability of picking one card out of the box.
