		\item During the lockdown period, many families got bored of watching TV all the time. Out of these families, one family of 6 members decided to play a card game. 17 cards numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 17 are put in a box and mixed thoroughly. One card is drawn by one member at random and other family members bet for the chances of drawing the number either prime, odd or even etc.
