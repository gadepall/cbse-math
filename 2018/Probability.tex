
\begin{enumerate}

\item Mother, father and son line up at random for a family photo. If A and B
are two events given by A = Son on one end, B = Father in the middle, find P$\brak{\frac{B}{A}}.$


    \item Let $X$ be a random variable which assumes values $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 $such that 
    \begin{center}$2P(X = x_1) = 3P(X = x_2) = P(X = x_3) = 5P(X = x_4).$\end{center}
    Find the probability distribution of $X$.
    
    \item A coin is tossed $5$ times. Find the probability of getting $(i)$ at least $4$ heads, and $(ii)$ at most $4 $ heads.
    \item There are two boxes I and II. Box I contains 3 red and 6 black balls. Box II contains 5 red and $"n"$ black balls. One of the two boxes, box I and box II is selected at random and a ball is drawn at random. The ball drawn is found to be red. If the probability that this red ball comes out from box II is $\frac{3}{5}$, find the value of $"n"$.
