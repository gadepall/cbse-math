
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a line has the direction ratios $-18, 12, -4,$ then what are its direction cosines ?
      
    \item Find the cartesian equation of the line which passes through the point \brak{-2, 4, -5} and is parallel to the line 
    $\frac{x+3}{3}=\frac{4-y}{5}=\frac{z+8}{6}.$
    \item Find the equations of the tangent and the normal to the curve 

     $y=\frac{x-7}{\brak{x-2}\brak{x-3}}$ at the point where it cuts the x-axis.
    \item Find the value of  $\lambda$ for which the following lines are perpendicular to each other :

     \hspace{2cm} $\frac{x-5}{5\lambda + 2} = \frac{2-y}{5} = \frac{1-z}{-1};\hspace{0.5cm} \frac{x}{1} = \frac{y+\frac{1}{2}}{2\lambda} = \frac{z-1}{3}$

     Hence, find whether the lines intersect or not.
    \item Show that the height of a cylinder, which is open at the top, having a given surface area and greatest volume, is equal to the radius of its base.

    \item  Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are \brak{-1, 1}, \brak{0, 5} and \brak{3, 2},  using integration.

    \item Find the area of the region bounded by the curves $\brak{x - 1}  ^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 =1 , $ using integration.
