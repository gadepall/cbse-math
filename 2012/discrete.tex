\item The $17th$ term of an $AP$ is $5$ more than twice its $8th$ term. If the $11th$ term of the $AP$ is $43$, then find the $nth$ term. 

\item Sum of the first $14$ terms of an $AP$ is $1505$ and its first term is $10$. find its $25th$ term. 
\item In an $A.P.$, the first term is $12$ and the common difference is $6$. If the last term of the $A.P.$ is $252$, find its middle term. 
\item If $4$ times the fourth term of an $A.P.$ is equal to $18$ times its $18^{th}$ term, then find its $22^{th}$ term. 
\item The sum of $4^{th}$ and $8^{th}$ term terms of an $A.P.$ is $24$ and the sum of its $6^{th}$ and $10^{th}$ terms is $44$. Find the sum of first ten terms of the $A.P.$
