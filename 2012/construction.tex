\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a triangle $ABC$ with $BC = 7 \text{ cm}$, $\angle B = 45 \degree$ and $\angle C = 60 \degree$. Then construct another triangle, whose sides are $\dfrac{3}{5}$ times the corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$.

\item Construct a right triangle in which the sides , (other than the hypotenuse) are of length $6\text{ cm}$ and $8\text{ cm}$. Then construct another triangle, whose sides are $\dfrac{3}{5}$ times the corresponding sides of the given triangle.
