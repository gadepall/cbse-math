\begin{enumerate}
\item  The probability of getting an even number, when a die is thrown once, is :

 \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{1}{2}$\\
    \item $\frac{1}{3}$\\
    \item $\frac{1}{6}$\\
    \item $\frac{5}{6}$
 \end{enumerate}
 \item A box contains 90 discs, numbered from 1 to 90. If one disc is drawn at random from the box, the probability that it bears a prime-number less than 23 is :
 
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{7}{90}$\\
    \item $\frac{10}{90}$\\
    \item $\frac{4}{45}$\\
    \item $\frac{9}{89}$
 \end{enumerate}


\item A card is drawn at random from a well shuffled pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability that the drawn card is neither a king nor a queen.

\item A group consists of 12 persons, of which 3 are extremely patient, other 6 are extremely honest and rest are extremely kind. A person from the group is selected at random. Assuming that each person who is (i) extremely patient (ii) extremely kind or honesty. Which of the above values you prefer more.
\end{enumerate}
