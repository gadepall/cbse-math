\begin{enumerate}
\item The angle of depression of a car, standing on the ground, from the top of a
75 m high tower, is 30$\degree$. The distance of the car from the base of the tower
(in m.) is : \\
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item 25$\sqrt{3}$\\
    \item 50$\sqrt{3}$\\
    \item 75$\sqrt{3}$\\
    \item 150
 \end{enumerate}
 \item The horizontal distance between two poles is 15 m. The angle of depression of the top of first pole as seen from the top of second pole is 30$\degree$. If the height of the second pole is 24 m, find the height of the first pole. $\brak{ \pi = \frac{22}{7}}$
 
\item The angle of elevation of the top of a building from the foot of the tower is 30$\degree$ and the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the foot of the building is 60$\degree$. If the tower is 60 m high, find the height of the building. 
\end{enumerate}
