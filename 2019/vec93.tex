\item Find the coordinates of a point $\vec{A}$, where $\vec{AB}$ is diameter of a circle whose center is $\brak{2,-3}$ and $\vec{B}$ is the point $\brak{1,4}$.
\item Find the ratio in which the segment joining the points $\brak{1, 3}$ and $\brak{4, 5}$ is divided by $x-axis$? Also find the coordinates of this point on  $x$-axis.
\item Find the point on $y-axis$ which is equidistant from the points $\brak{5, -2}$ and $\brak{-3, 2}$.    
\item The line segment joining the points $\vec{A}\brak{2, 1}$ and $\vec{B}\brak{5, -8}$ is trisected at the points $\vec{P}$ and $\vec{Q}$ such that $\vec{P}$ is nearer to $\vec{A}$. If $\vec{P}$ also lies on the line given by $2x-y+k=0$, find the value of $k$.
\item Find the coordinates of a point $A$, where $AB$ is a diameter of the circle with centre $(-2, 2)$ and $B$ is the point with coordinates $(3, 4)$.
