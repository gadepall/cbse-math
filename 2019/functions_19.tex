\begin{enumerate}
\item Check whether the relation $R$ defined on the set $A=\cbrak{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ as $R =\cbrak {(a, b) : b = a + 1}$ is reflexive, symmetric or transitive.

\item Let $f$ : $N\rightarrow Y $ be a function defined as $f\brak{x}= 4x + 3$, where $Y=\cbrak{y\in N:y=4x+3, \text{ for some } x\in N}$. Show that $f$ is invertible. Find its inverse.

\item Examine whether the operation $*$ defined on $\vec{R}$, the set of all real numbers, by $a * b = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ is a binary operation or not, and if it is a binary operation, find whether it is associative or not.
\end{enumerate}
