\item Find the HCF of $1260$ and $7344$ using Euclid's algorithm.
\item Show that every positive odd integer is of the form $\brak{4q+1}$ or $\brak{4q+3}$, where $q$ is some integer.
\item Which term of the $AP$ $3, 15, 27, 39, ....$ will be $120$ more than its $21$st term?
\item If $S_n$ ,the sum of first $n$ terms of an $AP$ is given by $S_n=3n^2-4n$, find the $n$th term.
\item If the sum of first four terms of an $AP$ is $40$ and that of first $14$ terms is $280$. Find the sum of its first $n$ terms.
\item Prove that $\frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{5}$  is an irrational number, given that $\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number.
