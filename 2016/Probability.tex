\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A, B$ and $C$ throw a pair of dice in that order alternately till one of them gets a total of $9$ and wins the game. Find their respective probabilities of winning, if $A$ starts first.
    \item A random variable $X$ has the following probability distribution :
          \begin{table}[h!]
              \begin{center}
                  \begin{tabular}{|c |c| c | c | c | c | c | c |}
                      \hline
                      X        & 0   & 1    & 2    & 3    & 4     & 5      & 6         \\
                      \hline
                      $\pr{X}$ & $C$ & $2C$ & $2C$ & $3C$ & $C^2$ & $2C^2$ & $7C^2 +C$ \\
                      \hline
                  \end{tabular}
              \end{center}
          \end{table}
          Find the value of $C$ and also calculate mean of the distribution.
    \item A committee of $4$ students is selected at random from a group consisting of $7$ boys and $4$ girls. Find the probability that there are exactly $2$ boys in the committee, given that at least one girl must be there in the committee.
    \item Five bad oranges are accidently mixed with $20$ good ones. If four oranges are drawn one by one successively with replacement, then find the probability distribution of number of bad oranges drawn. Hence find the mean and variance of the distribution.
    \item In a game, a man wins \rupee $5$ for getting a number greater than $4$ and loses \rupee $1$ otherwise, when a fair die is thrown. The man decided to throw a die thrice but to quit as and when he gets a number greater than $4$. Find the expected value of the amound he wins/loses.
    \item A bag contains $4$ balls. Two balls are drawn at random \brak{\text{without replacement}} and are found to be white. What is the probability that all balls in the bag are white ?
