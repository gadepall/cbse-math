\item A diet is to contain at least 80 units of vitamin A and 100 units of minerals.Two foods F1 and F2 are available at costing \rupee~5 per unit \rupee~6 per unit respectively.One unit of food F1 contains 4 units of vitamin A and 3 units of minerals whereas one unit of food F2 contains  3 units of vitamins A and 6 units of minerals.Formulate this as a linear programming problem.Find the minimum cost of diet that consists of mixture of these two foods and also meets minimum nutritional requirement.
 
     \item A company manufactures two types of cardigans:type A and type B.It costs \rupee~360 to make a type A cardigan and \rupee~120 to make a type B cardigan.The company can make at most \rupee~300 cardigans and spend at most \rupee~72000 a day.The number of cardigans of type B cannot exceed the number of cardigans of type A by more than \rupee~200.The company makes a profit of \rupee~100 for each cardigan of type A and \rupee~50 for every cardigan of type B.
 Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem to maximise the profit to the company.Solve it graphically and find maximum profit.
