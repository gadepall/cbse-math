\item Write the coordinates of the point which is the reflection of the point$({\alpha},{\beta},{\gamma}) $ in the $ XZ$ - plane.
\item On her birthday Seema decided to donate some money to children of an orphanage home. If there were 8 children less,every one would have got \rupee~10 more.However,if there were 16 children more,every one would have got \rupee~10 less.Using matrix method,find the number of children and the amount distributed by Seema.What values are reflected by Seema's decision?
\item Find the coordinates of the foot of perpendicular and perpendicular distance from the point p(4,3,2) to the plane x+2y+3z=2.Also find the image of P in the plane.
 \item Show that height of the cylinder of greatest volume which can be inscribed in a right circular cone of height $h$ and semi-vertical angle $\alpha$ is one-third that of the cone and the greatest volume of the cylinder is $\frac{4}{27}\pi h^{3}\tan^{2}\alpha$
