\begin{enumerate}
    \item There are two types of fertilisers $A$ and $B$. $A$ consists of $12$\% nitrogen and $5$\% phosphoric acid whereas $B$ consists of $4$\% nitrogen and $5$\% phosphoric acid. After testing the soil conditions, farmer finds that he needs at least $12$ kg of nitrogen and $12$ kg of phosphoric acid for his crops. If $A$ costs \rupee $10$ per kg and $B$ cost \rupee $8$ per kg, then graphically determine how much of each type of fertiliser should be used so that nutrient requirements are met at a minimum cost.
    \item A company manufactures two types of cardigans : type $A$ and type $B$. It costs \rupee $360$ to make a type $A$ cardigan and \rupee $120$ to make a type $B$ cardigan. The company can make at most $300$ cardigans and spend at most \rupee $72,000$ a day. The number of cardigans of type $B$ cannot exceed the number of cardigans of type $A$ by more than $200$. The company makes a profit of \rupee $100$ for each cardigan of type $A$ and \rupee $50$ for every cardigan of type $B$. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem to maximise the profit to the company. Solve it graphically and find maximum profit.
